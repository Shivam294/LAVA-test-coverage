HOW?

1.  copy the whole 'LavaTestCoverage' plugin folder to your project/assets/Plugins
2.  add LavaTestCoverageGameObject to all scenes you are testing

that's it.

TROUBLE?

If something goes wrong on startup, I recommend you set this LavaHelper script higher in the script execution order in Unity settings.
